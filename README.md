This is the final project for ICS4U - Grade 12 Computer Science course taken in 2017. Developed using Eclipse IDE and WindowsBuilder tool.  
The idea of this project was to create an application for users to lease items instead of selling it like other platforms.  

### The goals are to:
- Earn extra money from leasing items that are currently not in use
- Allow others to borrow equipments and items without having to purchase it at a higher price
- Impact on the environment by reducing the numbers of people purchasing new items and put giving new purpose to owned items
- Create a community where people can lease almost anything!


# Technical aspects: 
### This project has the following functionalities:
- Login and sign up system for users to lease items 
- Login system for admins
- Allow users to add and remove items they own to the database
- Allow users to book which items they want to lease. Once booked, others cannot book the item. 
- Allow users to search and filter by certain criterias (Name, color, manufacturer, category, price, ...)
- Once the item is returned, the owner of the item can make it available again by pressing "Return"
- Allow admins to manage inventory, customer accounts and other admins
